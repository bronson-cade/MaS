Anyone can take out a payday loan - the lender does not check their credit score to determine risk.  Therefore, the lender must assume that everyone taking out a payday loan is high risk - even though that may not be true.  Payday loans are generally made for a short term, usually two weeks (the name comes from taking a loan until the next payday, when it can be paid back). At the end of the two weeks, the borrower must pay back the amount they borrowed plus a fee.  Payday loans are usually for small amounts - up to $1000 - and charge a fee of $10-$30 for each $100 borrowed [<a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-payday-loan-cfpb" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-payday-loan-cfpb.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.2: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: What is a Payday Loan">[1.2.11.1.2]</a>].  So you might borrow $200 and pay it back two weeks later, plus a $30 fee.  While this may not seem like much, this is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 360% - almost 20 times what a credit card might charge!  In <a href="payday-loans.html#payday-loans-interest" class="internal" title="Section 1.2.5: Simple and Compound Interest">Section 1.2.5</a> we’ll see how to compute how much interest a payday loan is charging.</div>

</h5>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-types-of-loans-bank-2">Traditional bank loans are very different than a payday loan.  The interest rate is determined by risk (credit score), the type of loan, and what kind of security the borrower can offer for the loan.  Bank loans will have much lower interest rates than payday loans, but are not available to everyone.  Many people get their first loan - when they don’t have a credit history - by having someone else <em class="emphasis">cosign</em> it.  A cosigner is someone, usually a parent or other relative, who agrees to pay back the loan if the borrower cannot.  Student loans are an example of a type of loan that often has a cosigner - if the borrower is a student, they may not have the credit history or security to borrow on their own.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-types-of-loans-bank-3">One popular type of bank loan, used by many consumers, is the credit card.  A credit card is effectively an agreement between the bank and the cardholder to loan any amount of money on a short-term basis, up to a certain amount - called the <em class="emphasis">credit limit</em>.  The cardholder agrees to pay back at least the interest on the loan each month, or pay a penalty.  If the cardholder doesn’t make their minimum payment each month, in addition to the penalty fees, the bank can cancel the credit card.  Falling behind on paying a credit card can quickly add up - both in fees and in damage to your credit rating.  If you have a high credit score, banks will usually agree to give you a credit card with a low interest rate.  If your credit score isn’t as good, though, they will either deny you a card entirely, offer you one with a high interest rate, or require you to secure the card (pay a deposit to cover any missed payments).</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-types-of-loans-bank-4">Many people take out bank loans to make major purchases, like homes or cars.  A <em class="emphasis">mortgage</em> is a bank loan which uses a home or piece of property as a security.  Many people use a mortgage to borrow money to buy a home.  If they fail to repay the loan, the bank gets to take the security - in this case, their home.  When the bank takes the security from the loan, it is called a <em class="emphasis">foreclosure</em> (usually used with homes and property) or a <em class="emphasis">reposession</em> (usually used with vehicles like cars or boats).  The result is the same - the bank takes the property which was used to secure the loan.  They are then able to sell that property to earn back the money that they loaned out.  Interest rates for these types of loans tend to be much lower, because the opportunity to foreclose on the property gives the bank a way to earn their money back even if the borrower does not repay the loan.</div></section><section class="subsubsection" id="payday-loans-types-of-loans-government"><h5 class="heading hide-type">

</h5>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-types-of-loans-government-2">The government - both state and federal governments in the US - is also an important provider of loans.  These loans are either provided directly by the government or secured by the government (a private bank makes the loan, and the government provides the security for the borrower). In some cases - like subsidized student loans - the government may even pay part of the interest.  Government loans provide access to money for people in need, but the process for getting one can be complicated and take time.  In addition, many government loans are restricted to particular groups, like veterans, small businesses, or first-time college students.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-types-of-loans-government-3">Some government loans can be <em class="emphasis">forgiven</em>, meaning that the government does not require the loan to be paid back in exchange for some form of service from the borrower.  For example, government student loans can be forgiven after ten years of work in public service, as long as certain requirements are met.</div></section><section class="subsubsection" id="payday-loans-types-of-loans-pawn"><h5 class="heading hide-type">

</h5>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-types-of-loans-pawn-2">A pawn is a short-term secured loan, usually made to someone with a low or no credit score.  In a pawn, the borrower brings a valuable object (usually something small, like jewelry or electronics) to a pawn shop.  The pawnbroker pays them some percentage of the value of the item, generally less than half.  The borrower must then repay the amount, plus interest.  If the borrower doesn’t pay the money back, the pawnbroker can sell their item to recoup their investment.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-types-of-loans-pawn-3">Pawns generally offer more favorable interest rates than payday loans, since the loan is secured.  However, the borrower loses the ability to use whatever they have pawned while the money is borrowed.  For something like jewelry, that can mean living with the anxiety of losing a valuable or sentimental item.  For something like electronics, it could impact their ability to communicate or work.</div></section></section><section class="subsection" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending"><h4 class="heading hide-type">

</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending-3">So if the ECOA exists, banks are unable to discriminate against different types of people, right? Unfortunately, no. While the ECOA makes it illegal to discriminate in mortgage lending, enforcement of the law is very challenging.  It is very difficult to prove, in a situation where so many different factors are involved, that race or national origin influenced the lenders decision.  Many lenders use complex computer algorithms to decide whether to lend to a particular borrower.  Frequently, these algorithms are <em class="emphasis">trained</em> in a process called <em class="emphasis">machine learning</em>, where the computer studies data from past loans.  The computer finds patterns in the data, and uses those patterns to make decision about whether to lend and what terms to offer.  Because that data is based on past lending decisions made by human beings, it can (and does) contain biased decisions made by those human beings.  Research has shown that these algorithms replicate the patterns of racial and ethnic discrimination that were made in the data they are trained on.<a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-mortgage-discrimination" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-mortgage-discrimination.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.5: Disparity in home lending costs minorities millions, researchers find.">[1.2.11.1.5]</a>  Therefore, although overt discrimination is forbidden in lending, it still occurs.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending-4">In addition to the discrimination that occurs through implicit bias (both in humans and in algorithms), the ECOA, and other similar laws in different countries, still allow banks and other lenders to discriminate on the basis of risk.  Banks can choose whether or not they want to lend someone money based on how likely that person is to pay it back.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending-5">We’ve talked about how banks, the government, and other entities make decisions about who they will loan money to.  Those decisions are made primarily on the basis of two things: credit history and access to security.  If someone has a strong credit history - they have borrowed money and paid it back on time - or if they have access to property or someone with credit history to secure their loan - then they can obtain favorable terms for a loan.  If they do not have either of those things, then they are left to borrow money from lenders who demand much higher interest payments.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending-6">This brings us to the question, then, of which groups of people have access to those things.  Although the ECOA banned discrimination in the loaning of money in 1974, access to credit tends to be passed down through generations.  If your grandparents did not have access to credit, they may not have been able to support your parents when they needed to borrow money for education or a first home - in which case, your parents would be unable to offer the same opportunities to you.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending-7">Thus, the question of who has access to affordable credit can become a question of who has access to generational wealth.  Wealth is defined as the value of a family’s assets - both money saved in bank accounts and investments as well as property like homes and cars - minus their debt.  Studies have shown that Black Americans (as well as other people of color) have far less wealth than white Americans.  In 2016, a study found that the median wealth of Black households was less than 10% of that of similar white households <a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-mortgage-discrimination" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-mortgage-discrimination.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.5: Disparity in home lending costs minorities millions, researchers find.">[1.2.11.1.5]</a>.  Wealth tends to accumulate in families over time.  This can be direct, like inheritance, where one generation receives wealth (money or property) directly from the previous one.  It can also be indirect.  For example, a college student may indirectly inherit generational wealth when their parents pay for part or all of their college, or when they win a scholarship from opportunities provided by their parents.  This allows them to avoid taking on debt to pay for college, which would decrease their overall wealth.  This accumulated wealth, then, gives them greater opportunities to credit in their future.  The effect of generational wealth can be seen in the paradoxical relationship between wealth and debt in America.  Even though they have 10 times the median wealth, white households have median debt which is more than twice as high as Black households <a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-mortgage-discrimination" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-mortgage-discrimination.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.5: Disparity in home lending costs minorities millions, researchers find.">[1.2.11.1.5]</a>.  The debt held by white households, though, tends to be less costly than that held by Black households.  Much of this discrepancy is due to access to cheaper forms of debt like home mortgages, home equity loans, and student loans.  Black households tend to hold more of their debt in more expensive forms of credit like credit card debt and installment loans.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending-8">On the surface, payday loans are available to anyone.  Because wealthier and white households tend to have access to other forms of credit, payday loans tend to be used primarily by poorer households and people of color.  People who do not own their own home are 57% more likely to use payday loans than homeowners.  People without a 4-year college degree are 82% more likely to use payday loans than those with degrees.  Race, though, was the greatest predictor of whether someone had used a payday loan - Blacks were more than twice as likely (105% more likely) to have used a payday loan as individuals of other races and ethnicities, even after controlling for other factors like income level and homeownership <a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-race-and-payday-lending" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-race-and-payday-lending.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.7">[1.2.11.1.7]</a>.  If access to credit were only determined by risk - factors like income and access to security - we could expect the percentage of white and Black borrowers to be similar.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending-9">In addition to the obstacles imposed by lending discrimination and lack of generational wealth, there are other reasons why people would turn to predatory forms of lending. One very simple reason is where they live.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending-10">A study in 2019 found that there are simply fewer banks in majority Black neighborhoods.  In areas where the majority of residents were white, there was an average of 41 banks &amp; other financial institutions per 100,000 people.  In majority non-white neighborhoods, that number fell to 27 per 100,000.  Furthermore, banks in majority Black neighborhoods tended to charge higher fees than those in majority white neighborhoods <a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-race-and-banking" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-race-and-banking.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.8: African Americans underserved by U.S. banks: study">[1.2.11.1.8]</a>.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-discriminatory-lending-11">The lack of banks in majority Black neighborhoods is mirrored by a greater concentration of payday lenders.  A 2016 study in California found that the neighborhoods where payday lenders were concentrated were much more likely to be majority Black or Latinx <a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-payday-lending-in-black-neighborhoods" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-payday-lending-in-black-neighborhoods.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.9: The Demographics of California Payday Lending: A Zip Code Analysis of Storefront Locations">[1.2.11.1.9]</a>.

Redlining was the (now illegal) practice of singling out minority neighborhoods for mortgage discrimination, denying loans to people buying homes in those neighborhoods.  Redlining is considered a major contributor to the generational wealth gap between Black and white americans.  Similarly, reverse redlining creates neighborhoods without access to low-interest credit - not because of bank policies, per se, but because of physical proximity to lending institutions.</div></section><section class="conclusion" id="payday-loans-background-5"><div class="para" id="payday-loans-background-5-1">We’ve learned a lot about payday lenders - how they operate, why people use them, where they are, and what they do.

In compound interest, rather than just taking a percentage of the amount once, interest is calculated regularly - every day, month, year, or some other unit of time.  This causes interest to accumulate more rapidly, since you are taking a percentage not just of the original amount, but also of any interest that has already been added on.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-compound-interest-3">For example, imagine you borrow $100 at 5% interest for 10 years.

Your credit score is a number - usually between 300 and 850 in the United States - which tells a lender how likely you are to repay borrowed money.  We can think of a credit score in terms of probability.</div></section><section class="subsection" id="payday-loans-probability"><h4 class="heading hide-type">

</h4>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-probability-2">The <em class="emphasis">probability</em> of a particular event occurring is a number between 0 and 1 (or, equivalently, between 0% and 100%) which measures how likely that event is to occur.  If something has a probability of 0, that means it will never happen.  If it has a probability of 1, then it will always happen, no matter what.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-probability-3">Usually, when we study probability, we talk about simple situations where it’s easy to determine the probability.  For example, if you roll a 6-sided die, the probability that you get a 6 is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{6}\)</span> because you’re looking at 1 possibility out of 6 total.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-probability-4">However, in the real world, probabilities are usually much more complicated to determine.  To calculate your credit score, credit reporting agencies use many different factors - how long you’ve had loans or credit cards, how many times you have been late paying your bills, and the types of loans and credit cards that you have. There is no simple formula to calculate how likely you are to repay a loan.  The credit score summarizes the complicated calculations that have gone into determining the likelihood of you paying back money that you borrow.</div>
<div class="para logical" id="payday-loans-probability-5">
<div class="para">Although it is an oversimplification of the actual situation, we’ll use the credit score as a simple measure of probability so that we can see an example of how it works.  We’ll treat a score of 300 - the lowest score - as meaning that the probability you pay back a loan is 0%.  We’ll say that a credit score of 850 means that there is a 100% chance that you pay back the loan on time.  We’ll treat every score between as a number between 0 and 100% using the formula</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{credit score - 300}{850-300}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">So a credit score of 700, in our simplification would mean a <span class="process-math">\(\frac{700-300}{850-300} = 0.73 = 73\%\)</span> chance of repaying the loan on time.</div>

</h4>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-expected-value-2">Once banks determine how likely you are to repay a loan, they can make a decision about whether they will loan you money, whether that’s as a student loan, credit card, or something else.  They use the credit score to determine the amount of money they can expect to make off of the loan.  If you don’t repay the loan, they will lose all of the money that they loaned you.  If you do repay the loan, then they make money - in the form of the interest that you pay back on the loan.  This is called the <em class="emphasis">expected value</em> of the loan.  It depends on both the probability that a borrower will pay back the loan, the amount of money being borrowed, and the amount of interest that the bank will make off of the loan.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-expected-value-3">Before we look at the expected value of a loan, let’s define the expected value in general.  Expected value works by using the probability to weight the reward of different events happening.  Consider this example: Say a friend makes you an offer.  They’ll flip a coin.  If the coin comes up heads, they’ll pay you $1.  If the coin comes up tails, you pay them $1.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-expected-value-4">If you play the game just once, you’ll end up either $1 richer or $1 poorer - there’s a 50% chance of either.  If you play it twice, you either win both, win the first and lose the second, lose the first and win the second, or lose both - so there are 4 possibilities.  If you win both times, you’re $2 richer.  If you win one and lose one (either of the middle two situations) you’re back where you started - $0 richer.  If you lose both, you’re $2 poorer.  If you average out the different scenarios, you end up exactly where you started - there’s exactly the same chance of winning money as losing.  So we say the expected value is $0 - on average, we don’t expect to end up with any more money than we started with.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-expected-value-5">Expected value depends on probability - so it certainly isn’t saying that if you play that game with your friend, you won’t win any money! You could play 10 times and win every time...it just isn’t very likely (the chance of that happening is a little less than 1/1000)</div>

<div class="para logical" id="payday-loans-expected-value-6-2">
<div class="para">Suppose you have multiple different possible events, each with some probability of occurring, and each with some "reward" our "benefit" (penalties or losses are represented as negative rewards).

In practice, a bank would charge considerably more interest for an unsecured loan if there were such a large chance they would get none of the money back - if they would loan it at all.  If you don’t pay back your loan, your bank will sell the debt to a debt collector - who will pay them what they think the loan is worth, usually a fraction of the loan.  The debt collector will then attempt to get the money back through legal actions like lawsuits and garnished wages.</div>

<div class="para logical" id="payday-loans-correlation-definition-2">
<div class="para">Suppose we have two sets of numbers:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{1,2,5,6,12}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{2,4,10,12,24}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">If someone told you that the next number in the first set was 30, what would you expect the next number in the second set to be?  You would probably guess 60, because there’s a clear pattern here - the number in the second series is always exactly double the corresponding number in the first series.</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical" id="payday-loans-correlation-definition-3">
<div class="para">In practice, when we look at two sets of data, the relationship between them is rarely this exact.  For example, look at these two sets of data:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{1,2,5,6,12}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{2,5,9,14,21}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The values in the second set are just a little bit off from two times as much as the first set.  If someone told you the next number in the first set was 30, though, you would still probably expect the next number in the second set to be approximately 60 - maybe not exactly 60, but something close.  Even though one number doesn’t exactly predict the other, it comes pretty close.</div>
</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-correlation-definition-4">The correlation is a way of measuring how closely one set of numbers predict another.  The correlation gives a number between 1 and -1.  A correlation of 0 means that there is absolutely no relationship between the two sets of numbers - when one changes, you can’t predict what will happen to the other.  A correlation of 1 means that there is a perfect relationship between the numbers - when the values in the first data set increase, the values in the second data set increases in a way that exactly corresponds.  Our first two sets of numbers would have a correlation of 1.  Our second pair would have a correlation close to 1, but not exactly 1.  A correlation of -1 also indicates a perfect relationship, but when one of the values in one set increases, the values in the second set will <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> in a way that exactly corresponds.  So the pattern is still perfect, but it works in reverse.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-correlation-definition-5">Computing the correlation is tricky.  We’ll go through the process of computing it, which takes multiple steps, but in general we’ll do it using software.  The R programming language lets us easily find the correlation between two sets of numbers.  Here, you’ll see the two data sets we looked at above.  The cor function in R calculates the correlation between two sets of numbers - hit "Evaluate R" to calculate.  You can try different values in the exercise below - just hit "Evaluate R" to find the correlation.  You’ll see that when we look at the first pair of data sets, the correlation is exactly 1: <div id="payday-loans-correlation-definition-5-1" class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-r"><script type="text/x-sage">x <- c(1,2,5,6,12)
y <- c(2,4,10,12,24)
cor(x,y)
</script></div> If we look at the second pair, though, the correlation is a little less than 1. <div id="payday-loans-correlation-definition-5-2" class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-r"><script type="text/x-sage">x <- c(1,2,5,6,12)
y <- c(2,5,9,14,21)
cor(x,y)
</script></div> 0.9812022 is still very close to 1, though, because these numbers still mostly fit the pattern - just not perfectly.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-correlation-definition-6">If we have numbers that are completely unrelated, though - where there is no pattern between how much one increases by and the other - we’ll see very low correlation: <div id="payday-loans-correlation-definition-6-1" class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-r"><script type="text/x-sage">x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
y <- c(7,-4,-3,-45,27)

<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-3-7">We can look at the correlations between these different data sets.  For example, the R code below calculates the correlation between the number of payday lenders and the white population of a county, which is -0.68.</div>
<div id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-3-8" class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-r"><script type="text/x-sage">lenders <- c(16, 15, 6, 6, 10, 10, 14, 82, 9, 14, 5, 23, 9, 51, 33, 9, 8, 15, 9, 17)

cor(lenders,percent.white)
</script></div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-3-9">This means that there is a negative correlation between the percentage of a county which is white and the number of payday lenders - that is, the more white people live in a county, the fewer payday lenders will you find.  Because Alabama is largely a biracial state (with non-white and non-Black minority populations making up a very small percentage of the population), we see a similar (but reversed) correlation between Black population and payday lenders of 0.67 - so more Black people in a county corresponds to more payday lenders. The R code to calculate that correlation is next.</div>

<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-3-11">When we see a correlation like this, as we discussed before, we need to remember that it’s not proof of a cause - just evidence.  One thing we should always be thinking about is the possibility of <em class="emphasis">confounding</em>.  Confounding is when another factor we’re not thinking about causes a change in our data.  For example, here, poverty could be a confounding factor.  Because of the deep legacy of racial inequality in the United States, Black people are more likely to live in poverty.  Could the correlation between counties with higher Black populations and payday lenders actually be because those counties are poorer?  Let’s look and see if there is a correlation between median income and the number of payday lenders.</div>

<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-3-13">The correlation here is 0.02, extremely close to 0.

So median income doesn’t predict the number of payday lenders nearly as well as race.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-3-14">In the exercises, we’ll consider another possible confounding factor - population.

</h4>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-2">The second argument made for why payday loans are "fair" is that the lenders are taking a large risk by making the loans - so they should be entitled to charge high interest rates. One question here - which we won’t focus on - is whether it is fair to charge interest at all, or if our society should have a more effective way of providing capital to those who lack it. <a class="external" href="https://www.kiva.org/" target="_blank">Kiva</a><details class="ptx-footnote" aria-live="polite" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-2-2"><summary class="ptx-footnote__number" title="Footnote 1.2.3"><sup> 3 </sup></summary><div class="ptx-footnote__contents" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-2-2"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">www.kiva.org/</code></div></details> is a non-profit organization that provides loans without interest worldwide, for example.  But even working within the existing framework of capitalism, where any money borrowed must be repaid with interest, we can ask the question of what level of interest is fair.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-3">Let’s look at how much money payday lenders are making on loans, through the lens of expected value.  In 2015, the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) found that 46% of all payday loan borrowers <em class="emphasis">defaulted</em> on their loans within two years <a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-crl-defaults" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-crl-defaults.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.16: Payday Mayday:Visible and Invisible Payday Lending Defaults">[1.2.11.1.16]</a>.  A default on a loan occurs when the lender is unable to meet the terms of the loan. While this doesn’t necessarily mean that they didn’t pay the loan back (in fact, the CRL found that 66% of those defaulting eventually paid their loans back in full, plus any fees that they would have paid for defaulting, like late fees), it does mean that the lender is losing some money on the investment.  The same study found that 20% of loans are <em class="emphasis">charged off</em> within two years, meaning that the lender gives up on collecting the debt. Again, this doesn’t mean they lose all of their money, since the loans are then usually sold to a debt collector who tries to collect some or all of the money, but they do lose much of their investment in this case.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-4">Obviously, these situations are very complicated, and there are a lot of possible results, so as we did before, we’ll consider a simplified version.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-5">Let’s assume that 20% of the time, the lender loses everything (the loan is charged off).  26% of the time (in the other defaults), they get paid back the full value of the loan, plus the interest, plus late fees.  In the remaining 54% of cases, the lender pays back the loan in full.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-6">In a 2014 report, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that the median payday loan sequence is repaid after one month <a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-cfpb-payday-lending-report" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-cfpb-payday-lending-report.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.17: CFPB Data Point: Payday Lending">[1.2.11.1.17]</a>.  So in our scenario above, there are 3 possibilities - 20% of the time, the lender loses everything; 26% of the time, they get back the loan, plus the interest and late fees; and 54% of the time they get their loan back plus interest.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-7">Let’s say someone borrows $300 for one month in California at a 460% interest rate.  The late fee for a defaulting lender is $25. How much money should the payday lender expect to make off of them?</div>
<div class="para logical" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-8">
<div class="para">First we need to calculate the interest paid, using the simple interest formula:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A = 300 + 300*4.60*\frac{1}{12} = \$415
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The borrower ends up paying $415 total, or $115 in interest.</div>
</div>
<div class="para logical" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-9">
<div class="para">Now we can calculate expected value.  We take each probability and multiply it times the amount that the lender earns (or a negative value, if they lose money).  Then we add them up.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
0.20*(-300) + 0.26*(115+25) + 0.54*(115) = \$38.50
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">On average, the lender earns $38.50 on the $300 loan.</div>
</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-10">Of course, many borrowers end up renewing their loans for much more than a month.  Unlike a borrower who pays back their loan quickly, who may just have a temporary emergency need for money, these borrowers struggle to ever pay back their loan, racking up more fees each time they renew the loan.</div>
<div class="para logical" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-4-11">
<div class="para">What if we look at the exact same scenario, but the borrower borrows the money for a year?  Then they will pay back a total of</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A = 300 + 300*4.60*1 = \$1680
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The borrower ends up paying $1,680 total, so $1,380 in interest.  If they default on the loan, they also end up paying late fee (possibly more than one, but let’s assume just one).  We can calculate the expected value for the payday lender:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
0.20*(-300) + 0.26*(1380+25) + 0.54*(1380) = \$1050.50
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">For every borrower that pays their loan back after a year of fees, on average, the lender can expect to earn $1050.50!  This illustrates the fundamental mechanic of payday lending - the lenders make more money if they lend to borrowers who can just barely afford to pay the loan back.  They have a vested interest in lending to people who are struggling to get by instead of those who are dealing with an unexpected emergency.</div>

</h4>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-5-2">This point, of all those made, is the most salient.  Payday lenders exist because for many people with poor credit, there are no other options.  If a borrower has something of value to pawn, they could use a pawn broker - but for people struggling to get by, things of value may be too precious to pawn (the computer that a student uses for school; heirloom jewelry; the car used to get to work).</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-5-3">However, as compelling as this argument might be, it turns out to be false.  Many states have banned payday lending, usually by setting a cap of 36% on annual interest rates.  While this cap may seem high when compared to interest rates on credit cards and other types of loans, it is generally low enough to make payday lending untenable.  In 2017, the Center for Responsible Lending studied states which have passed these kinds of bans, and found that banning payday loans did not significantly impact borrowers’ access to credit <a href="payday-loans.html#biblio-shark-free-waters" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/biblio-shark-free-waters.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Bibliographic Entry 1.2.11.1.18: Shark‐Free Waters: States are Better Off without Payday Lending.">[1.2.11.1.18]</a>. Borrowers who would otherwise have used a payday loan, had they been legal, turned to products such as lines of credit, installment loans, loans from religious institutions, and payment plans with creditors.  Because of the high interest rates and predatory fees, researchers found that taking out payday loans actually made consumers more likely to have negative financial outcomes, like declaring bankruptcy.</div>
<div class="para" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-5-4">In the absence of payday lenders, financial institutions like credit unions can fill the gap.  Many credit unions, which are non-profits, offer payday alternative loans to their members.  These loans function much like payday loans, but with interest rates that are much more reasonable.  Removing bad actors like payday lenders creates more space for financial services like these to be successul in our communities.</div></section><section class="subsection" id="payday-loans-solving-for-change-6"><h4 class="heading hide-type">
